# Project Overview
This analysis aimed to explore in-depth the dynamic world of video games, specifically to compare global and regional sales trends of games released from 1980 to 2016. Which publishers are behind the most successful games in each region, what are the most popular genres, which games sold the most each year, and how the consumer habits of North Americans, Japanese and Europeans differ when choosing platforms and genders to play are examples of some of the questions approached by this exploratory project. 


# Data source
The original dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings). This detailed dataset comprises over 16000 recordings of game names, platforms, ratings, year of release, publisher, genre, sales data (global and regional), and scores by critics and users.
